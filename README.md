## Summarizer API Setup

To use the on-device summarizer:

1. Go to `chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model` ‚Üí **Enabled**
2. Go to `chrome://flags/#prompt-api-for-gemini-nano` ‚Üí **Enabled**
3. Restart Chrome.
4. Verify the on-device model is downloaded at `chrome://on-device-internals/`

   * Look for the Summarizer model in the list.
5. Supported output languages: `en`, `es`, `ja`
6. Debug by running in DevTools console:

   ```js
   const API = globalThis.Summarizer || (globalThis.ai && globalThis.ai.summarizer);
   const caps = await API.capabilities();
   console.log(caps);
   ```

## Notes on Tab Extraction

* **Content scripts are not automatically injected into tabs that were already open before installing the extension.**
* To fix this, `background.js` now explicitly injects `content.js` into all open tabs on:

  * extension **install**
  * browser **startup**
  * whenever the **Tab Feed panel is opened**

This ensures even existing tabs get parsed and summarized right away.

---

## Known limitations

* Chrome Web Store pages, `chrome://` URLs, and some system pages cannot be injected (extension limitation).
* Some sites may yield very large bodies of text ‚Äî only the first 4‚Äì8k characters are summarized for performance.
